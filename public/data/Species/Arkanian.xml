    [H4]Arkanian[h4]
    The Arkanians are a near-Human species which reside primarily on the frozen planet
    of Arkania in the Perave system of the Colonies region of the galaxy.
    [P][B]Physiology:[b]
    Arkanians considere themselves the pinnacle of evolution, and as such many are
    distinctly arrogant. Arkanian scientists have been experts in genetic manipulation
    for millennia, and by the time of the Mandalorian Wars the species had been split
    into many sub-species, making it hard to determine exactly what a baseline Arkanian
    is. Most could pass for Human, though the most pure of blood had pure white eyes
    and four clawed digits on each hand.
    [P]Arkanians are capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, and their eyes are
    sensitive to sources of extreme heat. This is helpful on their dark and frigid
    homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many are forced to wear blinders on
    planets with hotter, younger suns. It is also not unusual for an Arkanian to
    enhance themselves with internal and/or external cybernetics. It is also standard
    practice for Arkanians to undergo genetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing
    themselves so as to be better than lesser species.
    [P][B]Society:[b]
    The most defining trait of the Arkanian species is their arrogance which stemmed
    from their belief that they were the pinnacle of evolution. This leads to them often
    appearing arrogant and aloof to others as they see themselves as being superior to all
    other species. Even those with a more moderate viewpoint tended to see themselves as
    being amongst the most intelligent beings in the galaxy. As such, they are highly
    confident of their abilities.
    [P]Visitors to their homeworld often face unpleasant and arrogant Arkanians—despite
    this, Arkanians are deeply offended by impoliteness and when this occurrs, the offending
    individual needs to make amends quickly or risk being ostracized. When offended, an
    Arkanian typically speaks badly of the other party once they are gone and when no apology
    is given—the Arkanians are known to lock up the person or detain their starship from
    leaving the planet with overt threats. Even at this point, however, it is possible to
    redeem themselves in the eyes of an Arkanian though failure means that they became even
    more offended and storm away. But, if successful, the individual needs to also offer a
    gift to the offended Arkanian as a sign of their sincerity.
    [P]Knowledge and research are highly prized within Arkanian society which means that
    many of the species are highly skilled scientists as well as academics. Their near
    boundless arrogance and great wealth as well as dedication is unmatched by others within
    their scientific community creating research projects that easily match those of the
    Galactic Empire. Imperial researchers often struggle to
    match the dedication of the Arkanians as their projects often took generations to
    unfold. In addition, they are not above using their intelligence and research to
    gain profit with their corporations massing great wealth due to medical treatments
    entering the market at opportune moments. Arkanian scientists are well known explorers
    and they are also famous for their skills in genetic manipulation which results from
    their fascination in the genetic make-up of other races. This has led to frequent
    experimentation on alien species, much to the subjects' detriment as a result of
    Arkanian involvement.
    [P]The Arkanians themselves are not above genetic experimentation with this avenue of
    research leading to the creation of the Arkanian Offshoots that are engineered to perform
    specific tasks. Occasionally, a number of racist pure blood Arkanians were known to conduct
    purges of the Offshoot population. Reactions to the Offshoots varied as some Arkanians
    viewed them as little more than tools or even as slaves but many believed that they are
    an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed.
    [P]Results of their scientific work has led to great advances in medical techniques
    throughout the galaxy whilst others are considered some of the greatest atrocities
    known. They are known to have made significant contributions in the fields of cybernetic
    medical technology and micro-circuitry. Their actions have, however, led to many races
    holding a negative view of their kind which resulted from the actions of their scientists.
    However, many Arkanians are either embarrassed or even horrified at the acts their kind
    has gone to in the name of science. The more conscientious of their kind tended to be
    favored as allies of the Jedi Order and the Republic through their darkest hours.
    [P][B]Homeworld:[b]
    Arkania is the adopted homeworld of the Arkanian species. It is covered with tundra
    and rich in diamonds and other precious minerals, which the Arkanians mine to further
    their offworld connections and master their technology. Arkanian cities are designed to
    keep the cold out, and are mostly completely enclosed. Off-world visitors rarely have
    to deal with the frigid conditions of the planet.
    [P][B]Language:[b]
    The language of the Arkanian people was developed on their homeworld, Arkania before 
    they made contact with the civilized galaxy and the Galactic Republic. When contact 
    with the greater galaxy was established, young Arkanians were taught Arkanian and Basic, 
    so the majority of the population is bilingual. Among the Arkanian Offshoots, a 
    slightly different dialect gradually emerged, emphasizing words of submission and 
    forgetting those of victory or the desire to challenge.
