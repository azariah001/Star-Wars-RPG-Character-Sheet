    [H4]Aqualish[h4]
    The Aqualish are tusked bipeds from the planet Ando
    whose appearance combined aspects of arachnids and
    pinniped aquatic mammals. Aqualish had a reputation
    for being nasty, crude and aggressive, and generally
    pursued off-world careers as mercenaries, bounty
    hunters, and pirates. One of the most infamous such
    Aqualish was the smuggler Ponda Baba.
    [P][B]Physiology:[b]
    An amphibious species native to the planet Ando, the
    Aqualish people are made up of three distinct races
    which included the Aquala, the Ualaq and the Quara.
    Although they all had their differences, their
    baseline genetic structure was the same and their
    appearances did not vary so drastically as to
    characterize them as different species. All Aqualish
    have two facial tusks which curved down over their
    mouths; a trait which adds to their appearance as
    arachnids. Indeed, the Aqualish have some arachnid
    genetic material in their distant past, as
    demonstrative in their relationship with the Harch
    species. These facial tusks are highly sensitive
    to heat and cold, and were used for cracking open
    the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through
    the swampy loam of their homeworld.
    [P][B]Society:[b]
    The Aquala hate their Quara relatives, as they
    blame them for the image the Aqualish had on the
    galaxy as thugs. Because of this the latter
    subspecies are considered pariahs on Ando, which
    has a lower population of Aqualish than the galaxy
    itself. All three Aqualish subspecies speak
    mutually intelligible dialects of the same language.
    Quarrelsome and thug-like, the Aqualish culture
    revolves around aggression and toughness, with
    diplomacy being one of their weakest attributes.
    [P][B]Homeworld:[b]
    Ando, the homeworld of the Aqualish, is an oceanic
    planet located in the Ando system of the Mid Rim.  The
    sea covers 95% of the world.  The majority of the
    world's islands are sustained by a decaying swamp
    ecosystem and covered in steamy mist.
    [P][B]Language:[b]
    Aqualish is the official language of the planet 
    Ando, spoken by the Aqualish species. The three 
    subspecies of Aqualish—Aquala, Quara and Ualaq—each 
    have a different dialect. However, these regionalisms 
    are so similar that they are easily understood by 
    speakers of the separate dialects.
    [P]Aqualish vocal cords cause harsh guttural 
    sounds, which are common in the Aqualish language, 
    but uncommon in Basic. If an Aqualish speaks Galactic 
    Basic Standard, it sounds coarse and brutish. Most 
    Aqualish do not learn Basic unless they needed to, 
    which usually means they have been forced to leave 
    their homeworld.
